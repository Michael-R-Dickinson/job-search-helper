Code Style and Structure

- Write concise, technical Python code.
- Use descriptive variable names (e.g., `learning_rate`, `weights`, `gradients`).
- Organize code into functions and modules for clarity and reusability.
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines for Python code.
- Avoid code duplication whenever possible and, if running into poor practices unavoidably without making significant modifications beyond the scope of the prompt, you may stop generating code and discuss these issues with the user. 
- Aim to use abstraction to avoid code duplication.
